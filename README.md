# ldr-template

This is the Latex template for the Open-Science journal [Language Development Research](https://lps.library.cmu.edu/LDR/). It is based on the [word template](https://osf.io/8uepm).
 
To create your own article, clone this project and modify the [main.tex](main.tex). All formatting in line with the journal recommendations are set in the class file, [ldr-article.cls](ldr-article.cls).

The template is also available as an [overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ldr-template/fxjvwtfyhkyw).

## Rmd
